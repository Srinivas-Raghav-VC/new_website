## About Me

Hello! I'm Srinivas Raghav V C. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm driven by a curiosity to understand how things work, especially in the realms of **software development**, **machine learning**, and **data analysis**. This blog is my attempt to solidify my own understanding by explaining concepts and sharing projects I find interesting.

My journey into technology started with [mention starting point, e.g., a specific language, project, or course] and has since led me down paths exploring:

*   The fundamentals of algorithms and data structures.
*   Building web applications (often using JavaScript!).
*   The fascinating world of neural networks and AI.
*   Turning raw data into meaningful visual stories.

When I'm not coding or learning, you might find me [mention a hobby or two, e.g., reading sci-fi, hiking, playing chess].

I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge. I hope the articles here are helpful, spark curiosity, or maybe even start a conversation. Thanks for stopping by!
